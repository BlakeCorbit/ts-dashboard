# Data Recovery

Streamlined deleted notes/images recovery with one-click restore to TVP.

## Current Manual Process

1. Connect to avvpn
2. Open Retool, launch "Deleted Notes & Images Viewer v1"
3. Enter Shop ID and RO Number
4. Download images from Google Cloud URLs
5. Manually re-upload to TVP
6. Paste notes into correct labor lines

## What This Automates

Extends the existing Retool viewer with:

1. **"Restore to TVP" button** — directly re-uploads images and re-inserts notes without download/re-upload cycle
2. **Batch restore** — restore all deleted content for an RO in one click
3. **Audit log** — records what was restored, when, and by whom
4. **Zendesk integration** — auto-updates the support ticket with recovery confirmation

## Status

Planned — scaffold only. May be better implemented as a Retool enhancement rather than standalone.
